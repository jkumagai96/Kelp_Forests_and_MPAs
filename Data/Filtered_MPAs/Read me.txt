Filtered MPA dataset from NOAA, 2020 version with ArcMap. I filtered the data for the region 
where giant kelp forests are the dominant kelp species in California. USA/MEX border to lattitude 37.4.

Categorized MPAs in two types: Full protection (recreational and commercial fishing prohibited). 
Partial protection (some restrictions apply to recreational and commercial fishing).

I errased Sanctuaries.

I ensured that MPAs establsiehd during California MLPA, if they overlayed with older MPAs, that they kept 
the oldest year of implementation.
