This repository is for the paper, "Marine protected areas that preserve trophic cascades promote resilience of kelp forests to marine heatwaves," published in Global Change Biology. 

All of the data underlying the scripts can be found from the following resources available in the public domain at the links listed below
- SBC LTER California kelp canopy and environmental variable dynamics dataset (https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/c40db2c8629cfa3fbe80fdc9e086a9aa)
- MPA dataset (https://marineprotectedareas.noaa.gov/dataanalysis/mpainventory/)
- Monitoring and Evaluation of Kelp Forest Ecosystems in the MLPA Marine Protected Area Network data (https://doi.org/10.25494/P6/MLPA_kelpforest.9)
- GADM: https://gadm.org/data.html

To repeat the analyses in the paper, first, run the scripts in the folder Scripts/Calculate MHW, then scripts 1-16, and then the scripts in Scripts/Percent_Recovery. 
Finally, run the rest of the files in the scripts folder.
