The file, "kelp_data_w_mpas.csv" was created by Joy Kumagai (kumagaij@stanford.edu).

The file was transformed from the NetCDF provided by Tom Bell. The name of the file is:
CAkelpCanopyEnv_2021.nc

The data were first extracted to raster's with the resolution of 1km2, area 
was summed, while biomass, nitrate, hsmax, and temperature were averaged. 

Then, the data were converted to points, only pixels with data were converted to points
and filtered to latitude 37.4 (the point where giant kelp are found/dominating). 

These points were then transformed into a long data table, where each variable 
is a column. PixelID, lon, lat, and depth repeat within the dataset according to year. 

A file with MPAs within CA (does not include mpas in estuaries or sancutaries) was 
then intersected with these points. 

--- 
Therefore, the final dataset has the status (full, partial, or none) and ID of each mpa 
that intersected a kelp data point. 

Each kelp data also point has the year of the observation, area of kelp, biomass of kelp
maximum significant wave height (hsmax), nitrate, and temperature.

This read me file will be edited in the future following the development of the project.
